Task-1:

--> Develop a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender distribution within a population.
--> Population Age Distribution Visualization This Python script creates a bar chart to illustrate the age distribution within a population using data from an Excel file. It leverages pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and numpy for numerical 
    operations. 
--> The script processes the Excel file, manages missing data, calculates median ages, and plots the bar chart. The visualization highlights age categories (0-14, 15-64, 65+) and offers insights into their distribution. It is suitable for demographic analysis and can be 
    modified for different population datasets.



Task-2:
        Conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Examine relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.
        Titanic Dataset EDA and Data Cleaning This Python script performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. Using pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for visualization, and matplotlib for plotting, the script handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical data. 
        It provides insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and other factors like class, gender, and age. Visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and pair plots are used to explore correlations and uncover patterns in the data. This analysis offers a comprehensive view of the dataset and is adaptable for other datasets to identify trends and relationships.


Task-3:
         Develop a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset like the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
        Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier This Python script builds a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using the Bank Marketing dataset. The script utilizes pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model, and matplotlib for visualizing the decision tree. It begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and test sets. 
        The decision tree model is trained to classify whether a customer will purchase a product based on variables like age, job type, marital status, education level, and previous campaign interactions. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated, and the decision tree is visualized to understand the decision paths. This script is a practical tool for marketing analysis and can be adapted for similar datasets to predict customer behavior.


Task-4:
        Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
        Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Visualization This Python script conducts sentiment analysis on social media data to explore public opinions and attitudes toward a particular topic or brand. Using libraries such as pandas for data handling, NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, the script processes a dataset containing social media posts. It cleans the text data by removing noise (hashtags, mentions, URLs) and performs sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral). The results are visualized through bar charts, word clouds, and time series plots, showing sentiment distribution and trends over time. This analysis provides insights into public sentiment patterns and can be tailored to other datasets or topics to evaluate brand perception or public opinion effectively.



Task-5:
        Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
        Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization This Python script analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns associated with road conditions, weather, and time of day. Utilizing pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, the script processes a dataset containing detailed records of traffic accidents. It performs data cleaning, including handling missing values and categorizing variables related to road conditions (wet, dry), weather (clear, rainy, foggy), and time of day (morning, afternoon, night).
        The analysis identifies trends and correlations among these factors, allowing for the visualization of accident hotspots using heatmaps and geographic plots. The script also generates bar charts and line graphs to showcase the frequency of accidents in relation to different weather conditions and times of day. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for traffic safety improvements and can be adapted for other datasets to enhance understanding of accident causes and prevention strategies.
